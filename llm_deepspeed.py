# This script demonstrates how to use Deepspeed ZeRO in an inference mode when one can't fit a model
# into a single GPU
#
# 1. Use 1 GPU with CPU offload
# 2. Or use multiple GPUs instead
#
# First you need to install deepspeed: pip install deepspeed
#
# Here we use a 3B "bigscience/T0_3B" model which needs about 15GB GPU RAM - so 1 largish or 2
# small GPUs can handle it. or 1 small GPU and a lot of CPU memory.
#
# To use a larger model like "bigscience/T0" which needs about 50GB, unless you have an 80GB GPU -
# you will need 2-4 gpus. And then you can adapt the script to handle more gpus if you want to
# process multiple inputs at once.
#
# The provided deepspeed config also activates CPU memory offloading, so chances are that if you
# have a lot of available CPU memory and you don't mind a slowdown you should be able to load a
# model that doesn't normally fit into a single GPU. If you have enough GPU memory the program will
# run faster if you don't want offload to CPU - so disable that section then.
#
# To deploy on 1 gpu:
#
# deepspeed --num_gpus 1 t0.py
# or:
# python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=1 t0.py
#
# To deploy on 2 gpus:
#
# deepspeed --num_gpus 2 t0.py
# or:
# python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=2 t0.py

#
# - enable bf16 if you use Ampere or higher GPU - this will run in mixed precision and will be
# faster.
#
# - for older GPUs you can enable fp16, but it'll only work for non-bf16 pretrained models - e.g.
# all official t5 models are bf16-pretrained
#
# - set offload_param.device to "none" or completely remove the `offload_param` section if you don't
# - want CPU offload
#
# - if using `offload_param` you can manually finetune stage3_param_persistence_threshold to control
# - which params should remain on gpus - the larger the value the smaller the offload size
